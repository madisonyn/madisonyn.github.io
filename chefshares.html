      <h2>Chef Shares</h2>
      <p id="overview">This was a 5 week Human Centered Design Course project created in collaboration with my teammates
        Kai and Kiara. All communication amongst our team and participants was conducted via Zoom or phone, in
        accordance with COVID-19 safety guidelines. My primary role involved UX research, UX design, storyboarding, and
        illustration.</p>

      <h3>Research and Empathy Building</h3>
      <img src="images/chefshares/interviews.jpg" alt="chef shares interviews">
      <p>In order to determine a specific problem amongst our users of parents during shelter-in-place, we collectively
        conducted five different interviews with parents with various family structures. During these interviews, our
        goal was to glean a better understanding of our participants' experiences. We also wanted to create a space for
        honest dialogue by asking open-ended questions which allowed them to feel comfortable sharing about their
        frustrations, concerns, or positive experiences throughout shelter in place. Some open-ended questions we asked
        were: <b>"How is being sheltered-in-place different than your normal life?</b> and <b>"Do you miss anything from
          before you were sheltered in place? If so, can you tell us about it?"</b>
        <p>
          <br>
          <p>These interviews were extremely valuable in helping us gain a deeper care for our participants while also
            providing us insight into each of their unique conditions.</p>

          <h3>Unpacking</h3>
          <img src="images/chefshares/unpacking.jpg" alt="chef shares unpacking">
          <p>Following our interviews, we then unpacked all the great feedback we received to start forming a variety of
            potential inferences about what problems were most significant to our participants.</p>

          <img src="images/chefshares/empathymaps.jpg" alt="chef shares empathy maps">
          <p>To begin unpacking, we used an empathy map which helped us evaluate a meaningful challenge that we would
            soon develop for. First, we assessed our notes, looking for responses and quotes that we were surprised to
            hear. In doing so, we identified a particular participant that shared unique and vulnerable insight with us.
            Some surprising quotes we heard from her were: <b>"There's a level of measured resentment of my husband, he
              has this normal life, goes to work everyday, can continue his routine, but I can't even leave the
              house."</b> and <b>"I wish I could see my parents."</b> Moving forward, our goal was to develop empathy
            with our user by unpacking her experiences, trying to understand how she felt, and determining the broader
            thoughts behind words she shared with us. We learned that the most significant issue our participant was
            experiencing was a lack of social interaction with her friends and family, in addition to deeply missing the
            independence of her pre-pandemic routine.</p>

          <h3>About Our User<h3>
            <br>
              <iframe width="420" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1IIgtYXSs4o"></iframe>
          <br>
          <br>
              <p>The user we chose to design for is Sarah, a stay at home mother of 3 boys in middle school and high
                school. Before quarantine, she would spend hours driving her kids to school, activities, you name it,
                but while they were at school, she took that time to invest in her favorite hobbies, like going to
                thrift stores and estate sales, or catching up with friends.</p>
              <br>
              <p> When Covid hit America and shelter-in-place began, it was a difficult transition for Sarah, especially
                with her husband being a physician and having to work constantly. Due to the nature of his job, he would
                frequently have to separately quarantine himself from their family for 2 weeks. Oftentimes, it would
                just be her alone with her 3 boys which to her could feel <b>“suffocating.”</b> She emphasized that being alone
                with her kids at home all day meant <b>“there was no physical, mental, and emotional separation”</b> that she
                would get when they used to go to school.</p>
              <br>
              <p>After our interview with Sarah, we learned that she’s had a particularly rough time during quarantine
                with not having time to herself, battling sickness, and feeling disconnected with loved ones.</p>

              <h3>Point of View Statement</h3>
              <img src="images/chefshares/pov.jpg" alt="chef shares pov madlibs">
              <p>To start designing for our user, we developed a process to understand Sarah’s problems with a POV
                statement. Our main finding was that she needed a way to feel supported and connected to her loved ones,
                similarly to how she engaged with friends and family during pre-pandemic conditions. </p>

              <h3>Concept Ideation</h3>
              <img src="images/chefshares/concepts.jpg" alt="chef shares concepts">
              <p>With our POV Statement at hand and a deeper understanding of our target audience, it was time to start
                forming concepts. Each team member developed a concept that would allow parents to interactively
                reconnect with friends and family. Madison created a physical button that would track tasks completed
                utilizing the voices of loved ones, Kai created a voice assistant mobile app like Siri that would also
                use the voice of family and friends, and Kiara created a task tracker app where you could collaborate
                with anyone.</p>
              <br>
              <p> In brainstorming we eventually realized we needed a more linear and simple application, so we decided
                to focus on addressing one task and making it an engaging activity to virtually do with friends and
                family. The essential task we wanted to focus on was cooking, which showed to be an important part in
                the lives of parents during quarantine. The idea for the app would be combining the task of cooking and
                socializing to create a collaborative cooking competition app that makes it fun and accessible to
                reconnect with family and friends.</p>

              <h3>Prototyping</h3>
              <img src="images/chefshares/prototypes.png" alt="chef shares prototypes">
              <p>During the prototyping phase we used a multi-stage approach with wireframes, lo-fi, and mid-fi
                prototypes in order to refine our design and address Sarah’s struggle. Approaching the prototypes with a
                focus on linearity allowed us to hone in on the problem and address it in a way that was precise and
                consistent, leading to our refined prototype to hold the user’s hand through the whole process in a step
                by step manner that evolves based on factors such as friends available to cook, what ingredients each
                user has, and the inclusion of a optional competitive mode.</p>

              <br>

              <h3>User Testing</h3>
              <br>
              <p>It was then important to ensure that our app was intuitive, convenient, and met the user’s needs so we
                conducted usability testing to evaluate the current state of the project. We developed a script and
                tasks we wanted the user to give input on such as if they found the experience confusing or what
                features they connected with the most.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
                <h3 id="problemandsolution">Here's what we learned</h3>
                <br>
                  <ol type="1">
                    <li>Is simple with only 3 main functions</li>
                    <li>Needs more options to explore recipes</li>
                    <li>Has the potential to generate more excitement from the user experience</li>
                    <li>Assumes that cooking is a fun activity </li>
                    <li>Assumes the user is prepared to cook</li>
                    <li>Offers a linear experience</li>
                    <li>Aims to establish a sense of routine that incorporates socialization</li>
                  </ol>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>One of the key insights we found was our users being confused as to why somebody would use our app
                versus simply facetiming. We realized we need differentiating and exciting features that would create a
                better user experience so we built a feature to choose ingredients at hand for easy recipe
                accessibility.</p>

                    video calling a friend and cooking with them. One idea we had was having the option to change users
                    backgrounds to immerse them in a different environment, making them feel like they were not stuck at
                    home, but having a picnic in the park or on the beach. Having the option to make our users feel like
                    they were in a different setting would be another way to connect them with their pre-pandemic lives.</p>
