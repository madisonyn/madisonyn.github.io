      <h3 id="problemandsolution">Background</h3>
      <br>
      <p id="goal">The market for insect food products has become an expanding industry as they provide an alternative to the depletion of traditional food sources. Insects are rich in protein and contain a high nutritional profile.</p>
      <br>
      <p id="goal">With animal protein consuming massive amounts of natural resources and producing adverse climate effects, insect products offer a less costly and abundantly available option. They act as a more sustainable option when choosing protein products or snacks which has promoted a consumer demand for more insect-based alternatives.</p>

      <h3 id="problemandsolution">Objective</h3>
      <br>
      <p id="goal">Design a brand and package that increases exposure for insect food products by highlighting its use of natural resources and processes to create a fast degrading product after being used.</p>

      <h3>The Concept</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In the burgeoning industry of insect food products, Crunch Corn provides a unique option of crunchy insects, such as mealworms and crickets, in combination with popcorn coated with insect dust. Our initiative at Crunch Corn is to understand consumer concerns regarding insect-based foods and we strive to offer a product that is easily approachable. Whether you’re taking your first bite or returning for more, we always want you to be greeted by our crisp popcorn mixture and resealable packaging.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Crunch Corn is offered in a variety of flavors, from white cheddar to barbeque to salt and pepper. Using fresh, air-popped kernels and premiere sourced dried and dehydrated insects, we always ensure a high-quality product. We welcome folks of all ages to taste our product and discover the environmental and culinary benefits of insect-based food!</p>

      <h3>Brand Identity Development</h3>
          <img src="images/crunchcorn/crunchcornbranddev.jpg" alt="crunch corn brand development">
          <p>My process began with searching for a company identity, using simple sketches and word association to flesh out ideas. I decided that a mixture of insect-based foods in combination with a traditional snack would be an appetizing option for those new to the acquired taste of bug.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The name Crunch Corn derived from the initial companies name, Crunch. However, due to its potential with copyright issues, I ideated more to find a name that still included “crunch.” Crunch Corn naturally arose as the most apt brand name; it’s catchy and plays off a common pantry snack, popcorn.</p>

          <h3>Logo Ideation<h3>

            <br>
            <h3 id="problemandsolution">Sketches</h3>
              <p>My strategy for developing a logo consisted of various sketches of shapes, objects, and different variations of typography. With the target audience being children, I concentrated on bubbly letters and playful imagery.</p>
              <br>

              <br>
            <h3 id="problemandsolution">Digital Variations</h3>
                <p>While developing my logo, I went through an iterative process of receiving user feedback and adjusting colors and features accordingly. I found that my users identified most with logo variations that incorporated soft, rounded elements which appeared more playful and inviting. My final logo featured a rounded, bubble typeface with playful cartoon graphics that resonnated with my brand's youthful audience.</p>

              <p>To start designing for our user, we developed a process to understand Sarah’s problems with a POV
                statement. Our main finding was that she needed a way to feel supported and connected to her loved ones,
                similarly to how she engaged with friends and family during pre-pandemic conditions. </p>

              <h3>Concept Ideation</h3>
              <img src="images/chefshares/concepts.jpg" alt="chef shares concepts">
              <p>With our POV Statement at hand and a deeper understanding of our target audience, it was time to start
                forming concepts. Each team member developed a concept that would allow parents to interactively
                reconnect with friends and family. Madison created a physical button that would track tasks completed
                utilizing the voices of loved ones, Kai created a voice assistant mobile app like Siri that would also
                use the voice of family and friends, and Kiara created a task tracker app where you could collaborate
                with anyone.</p>
              <br>
              <p> In brainstorming we eventually realized we needed a more linear and simple application, so we decided
                to focus on addressing one task and making it an engaging activity to virtually do with friends and
                family. The essential task we wanted to focus on was cooking, which showed to be an important part in
                the lives of parents during quarantine. The idea for the app would be combining the task of cooking and
                socializing to create a collaborative cooking competition app that makes it fun and accessible to
                reconnect with family and friends.</p>

              <h3>Prototyping</h3>
              <img src="images/chefshares/prototypes.png" alt="chef shares prototypes">
              <p>During the prototyping phase we used a multi-stage approach with wireframes, lo-fi, and mid-fi
                prototypes in order to refine our design and address Sarah’s struggle. Approaching the prototypes with a
                focus on linearity allowed us to hone in on the problem and address it in a way that was precise and
                consistent, leading to our refined prototype to hold the user’s hand through the whole process in a step
                by step manner that evolves based on factors such as friends available to cook, what ingredients each
                user has, and the inclusion of a optional competitive mode.</p>

              <hr>

              <h3>User Testing</h3>
              <br>
              <p>It was then important to ensure that our app was intuitive, convenient, and met the user’s needs so we
                conducted usability testing to evaluate the current state of the project. We developed a script and
                tasks we wanted the user to give input on such as if they found the experience confusing or what
                features they connected with the most.</p>
              <br>
              <p>One of the key insights we found was our users being confused as to why somebody would use our app
                versus simply facetiming. We realized we need differentiating and exciting features that would create a
                better user experience so we built a feature to choose ingredients at hand for easy recipe
                accessibility.</p>

              <hr>

              <h3>Next Steps</h3>
              <br>
              <p>In future iterations, we would want to develop a feature that provided a unique experience from just
                video calling a friend and cooking with them. One idea we had was having the option to change users
                backgrounds to immerse them in a different environment, making them feel like they were not stuck at
                home, but having a picnic in the park or on the beach. Having the option to make our users feel like
                they were in a different setting would be another way to connect them with their pre-pandemic lives.</p>
